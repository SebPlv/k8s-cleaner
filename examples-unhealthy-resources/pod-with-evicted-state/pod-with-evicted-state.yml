# This Cleaner instance is designed to find all evicted Pod instances in all namespaces.
# It evaluates pods that have failed with the reason "Evicted" and marks them for deletion.
# The cleaner runs on a scheduled interval every 5 minutes, ensuring that evicted pods
# are promptly removed, freeing up cluster resources and maintaining a clean environment.
# By automatically deleting evicted pods, this Cleaner helps improve resource management
# and cluster performance.
