<h1>Kubernetes Controller Cleaner</h1>

## What is k8s-cleaner?

The Kubernetes controller Cleaner (k8s-cleaner) **identifies**, **removes**, or **updates** stale/orphaned or unhealthy resources to maintain a **clean** and **efficient** Kubernetes cluster.

It is designed to handle any Kubernetes resource types (including custom Kubernetes resources) and provides sophisticated filtering capabilities, including label-based selection and custom Lua-based criteria.

## Features and Capabilities

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Schedule**: Specify the frequency at which the k8s-cleaner should scan the cluster and identify stale resources. Utilise the Cron syntax to define recurring schedules.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **DryRun**: Enable safe testing of the k8s-cleaner filtering logic without affecting actual resource configurations. Resources matching the criteria will get identified, but no changes will get applied.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Label Filtering**: Select resources based on user-defined labels, filtering out unwanted or outdated components. Refine the selection based on label key, operation (equal, different, etc.), and value.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Lua-based Selection Criteria**: Leverage the [Lua](https://lua.org/) scripting language to create complex and dynamic selection criteria, catering to specific resource management needs. Define custom logic to identify and handle stale resources.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Notifications**: Stay informed! The k8s-cleaner keeps users in the loop about every cleaned-up resource, whether removed or optimized. Get detailed notification lists and pick your preferred channel: Slack, Webex, Discord, Telegram, Teams or reports.

## Benefits

üí™ **Resource Removal**: Efficiently remove stale resources from your cluster, reclaiming unused resources and improving resource utilisation.

üí™ **Resource Updates**: Update outdated resources to ensure they align with the latest configurations and maintain consistent functionality.

üí™ **Reduced Resource Bloat**: Minimize resource bloat and maintain a clean and organized cluster, improving overall performance and stability.

By combining the **flexibility** of **scheduling**, the **accuracy** of **label filtering**, the **power** of **Lua-based criteria**, and the ability to **remove** or **update** stale resources, the k8s-cleaner empowers users to effectively manage Kubernetes environments and optimise resource usage.

## Contribute

We encourage everyone to contribute to the example directory by adding new Cleaner configurations üí°. This will help the community benefit from different expertise and build a stronger knowledge base of the Cleaner use cases.

ü§ù Together we can expand the range of Cleaner applications and make it an even more valuable tool for managing Kubernetes resources efficiently.
